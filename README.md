# Techledge
Project for Digital Campus Paris - Culture Digitale course by Mr. Jonathan Munn


## Instructions
Design a collaborative website around the idea of 'Tech Canon'.

A user of this site can create one or more lists of documents that he or she considers to be part of "Tech Canon". 
The site does not host documents but must incorporate links either to sources, to additional information if the source documents are not
not readily available online.

## Proposed digital solution
A local website with functionalities and a graphic concept inspired by Spotify and other music streaming platforms.
